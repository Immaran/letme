My thesis - a program for controlling a computer by voice using ready-made and possible to add/edit commands.

Substitute for a voice assistant providing more practical functionalities for the best usage of the potential of the voice control. It allows you to define your own and edit built-in commands, to which the application will react with the activity of your choice, consisting not only starting the program or, e.g. controlling music, but also simulating user actions such as pressing the keys or their combinations. It gives us endless interacting possibilities with the operating system. This program can be a useful tool in the automation of repetitive activities or an interesting diversion in everyday computer usage.

App was implemented in C# language using WPF with Prism framework and AutoHotkey scripting language.

**Won't work without Windows speech recognition engine and AutoHotkey installed!**
